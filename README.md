Project Introduction: Predicting UFC Fight Outcomes Based on Fighter Statistics

Overview:
This project aims to analyze historical UFC fight data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to a fighter's success. The dataset, scraped from UFCStats using BeautifulSoup and processed with Pandas, compiles detailed fight statistics for every UFC event in history. Each row represents a single fight and includes performance metrics for both fightersâ€”categorized as "red" and "blue" based on their corner placement. The dataset provides pre-fight statistics, such as significant strikes and takedowns, for each fighter, aggregated from their past fights (excluding the current one). The primary objective is to determine how these statistics correlate with fight outcomes and to build a predictive model for fight winners.

Hypothesis:
Fighters with superior significant strike and takedown statistics are more likely to win their fights. By analyzing trends in past performance, we can explore whether these metrics serve as reliable indicators of success in the octagon.

Goals:
Data Exploration & Cleaning: Understand the structure and quality of the dataset, addressing any inconsistencies or missing values.
Feature Engineering & Selection: Identify key statistical indicators that contribute most to predicting fight outcomes.
Model Development: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict fight winners based on historical performance data.
Insights & Visualization: Present findings on which statistics have the greatest impact on winning, providing valuable insights into UFC fight dynamics.
